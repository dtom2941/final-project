I added some more objects to the mountainmaker.py file that I should probably change the name to just objectMaker or something along those lines
The changes include:
	adding car, which is just a box
	adding collisions to the mountains
	adding checkered pattern to mountains so that you can see terrain
	adding rock but not implementing completely the part that would enable it to be seen on the scene, it is only a bunch of vertices now
	making a super class that provides the underlying functionality of all of the objects

I changed the main.py file so that it can both have a flying mode(which was already there)
and a driving mode
I also made the flying mode able to add cars to the ground(because none of the other objects are ready to be displayed)
I also made directions appear on the screen which are selective to which state it is in
I made the car able to move along with the terrain so that its height would vary as it went over mountain object
I also made the camera able to go directly behind the car
